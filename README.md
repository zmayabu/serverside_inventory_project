----- Some Notes -----

There are initial JSON data for the Customer and Orders. There is only one admin role under zmaya so to use admin capability you should login with those credential. Any other Customer created will be automatically given customer role.

All _id's for the documents in each collection are manually set when adding a new document. That being said duplicate key errors can occur in special circumstances.
